# MVP scope for LPS metrics and visualisations


MVP scope for LPS metrics and 
visualisations
Interacting with and modify the report Dashboard 
MVP scope:
A dashboard view with widgets displaying 4 default metrics:
1. Percent plan complete for the ongoing Weekly work plan (WWP)
2. Reasons for variances logged
3. The number of constraints on activities in the look ahead window and 
which activities are constraint free
4. Schedule Planned progress vs actual progress
The view should be of the current week with the ability to change the period 
of time that you can view.
The ability to change the visualisation, allowing the user to stratify the data 
using metadata such as location, owner etc. At least one of the visualisation 
should show the chart stratified by location i.e.  the number of constraints by 
the location the constraints are assigned.
Considerations:
1. Do we provide specific charts only or provide a place in which they can 
create their own charts
2. What charts do we facilitate
3. If we were to deliver LPS support via the dashboard in the future, specific 
metrics and visualisation that support look ahead planning, would they 
live in the same place as this report dashboard.
