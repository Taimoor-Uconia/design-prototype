# Scenarios to deliver dashboards and reports for SC obligations


Scenarios to deliver dashboards 
and reports for SC obligations
Overview:
Sub contractors are obligated to report on specific pieces of information to 
the main contractors on a weekly or monthly basis. The weekly report must 
include: spent resources, earned resources, progress and constraints. 
Wayloader captures key elements of this information already. By expanding 
the scope of the information collected by Wayloader and representing this 
data via a dashboard, we could remove the need for clients to do this off 
platform and make the platform more sticky by removing manual pain points. 
The dashboard view could also serve as a location to export current and 
previous reports that display these data in a way that meets the SC contractual 
obligations.
Goal: 
Provide a dashboard and reporting location that is capable of displaying the 
critical information required by sub contractors. The dashboard location can 
be used to modify the select visualisations, traverse previous periods of time 
and export reports 
Pre-requisites for the SC dashboard and report
Ability to import resourcing information via Goal
A location for resources to exist and be modified in Plan
Ability to log resources against activities and/or boards

Scenarios that must be in place to achieve the Goal
1. Viewing obligated SC reporting requirements  
Given that sub contractors must regularly report specific metrics to the main 
contractor, and given that Wayloader already collates the main pieces of 
information that make up this report, Uconia must provide the ability to view 
the aggregate data for these specific metrics. This will not only provide the sun 
contractors with a live view of these critical metrics, but will also provide a 
location for the SC leads to export that data and report it up to the main 
contractor, as they are contractually obliged to do on a weekly basis. 
In LPS:
Sub contractors report to main contractors on their weekly work.  
General Contractor (GC) collate this data from multiple SCs and other sources 
and report upwards to the client.  
Sub contractor lead updates the specific resources that were spent at the end 
of the week.
Sub contractor operatives update the actual data daily on their tasks  
JTBD: As a sub contractor lead, I want to see and export the key metrics of my 
SC report on a weekly basis, such that I can guage the weekly success and 
fulfil my contractual obligations.
Flows:
SC operatives update the actual progress on tasks
SC lead updates the resourcing information on tasks/board level. 
SC lead view the dashboard to understand the aggregate data for the week
SC lead exports the dashboard view and send it to the main contractor
Main contractor assimilates many SC reports into their own report. 
Views: Report dashboard; visualisations of Key metrics; resource allocation 
screen; Export report screen.
Comments from Nazar during call: Where to display? List view view (retro 
look); Work Item View ( specific WI); Global Dashboards (filtered/ focused on

resourcing)
9 workers planned, 8 assigned, 7 actually sent to site on the week of work; 
Retro needs to show planned, assigned and on site actuals 
Output: Chart with axis for timeline; axis for resources assigned types 
breakdown (candle chart) (How will we see resource breakdown? maybe filter 
or separate charts for each as a breakdown)
2. Interacting with and modifying the report Dashboard 
Given that sub contractors must regularly report specific metrics to the main 
contractor, and given that a dashboard view exists in Uconia, Uconia 
dashboard view must provide the ability to modify and pivot the visualisations 
of the key metrics within the dashboard. This will enable the contractors to 
view the data in the most meaningful way and increase the liklihood of 
generating insight based on the data available. Finally, flexibility to view 
various time periods will help the SC lead to identify trends across multiple 
weeks or months based on previous data points. 
In LPS:
Sub contractors report to main contractors on their weekly work.  
General Contractor (GC) collate this data from multiple SCs and other sources 
and report upwards to the client.  
Sub contractor lead use the data from previous weeks to identify trends that 
they may need to address.
JTBD: As a sub contractor lead, I want to be able to view and manipulate the 
data in the dashboard to reveal insights that inform on site decisions, such 
that I can reduce the impact of current issues and predict future issues before 
they arise based on past data
Flows:
SC lead enters the dashboard area

SC lead views the default presentation of the key metrics of resources, planned 
vs actual progress and constraints. 
SC lead alters the resources view to represent a histogram with planned vs 
actual resources broken down by location
SC lead alters the constraint view to show number of constraints raised by 
each owner
SC lead alters the planned vs actual progress to show the past 9 weeks 
including this week
SC lead views the headline efficiency metric to understand this weeks 
performance
SC lead changes the dashboard view to last weeks dashboard to view the 
same data last week
SC lead understands where there is consistently problems arising and brings 
this information to look ahead planning
